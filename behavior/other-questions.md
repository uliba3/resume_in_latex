## What is your favourite food?

My favorite food is sushi. Growing up in Japan, I ate a lot of seafood, but sushi has always been my top choice. I especially love raw salmon with grilled cheese on top—it just melts in your mouth. Every time I go back to Japan, I make sure to have sushi.

I enjoy applying what I learn to my daily life, whether it’s experimenting with new tools or finding creative ways to solve problems.
