## 6 core competencies

- conflict resolution

    | Situation | Task | Action | Results |
    | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
    | Fun Hackathon 2024 | We came up with the idea of making speech to text and then reformat text using llm. But we had conflicts in terms of what kind of output we want. One side was with creating structured like JSON file for API endpoints and the other side was creating analysis like summarization or todoList. I was with analysis but it took almost half a day just arguing. | To make the project forward, I adviced to let's code the common parts first and test each side to see which one is better. So the project moves forward. | We compared the result and voted that live analysis is better. And won 2nd place in the hackathon. Through comparing by product, we were able to compare them better than comparing in theory or words. |

- adaptability

    | Situation | Task | Action | Results |
    | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
    | Omniscience Strategies | It was my first internship and it was a startup with 3 members team, so I was tasked in vast area including frontend, backend, infra, and DevOPs. Also living in completely new area. | I did my best with every task and made sure that I complete them. | I was able to contribute heavily to my internship, also getting extended internship offer. |

- perseverance

    | Situation | Task | Action | Results |
    | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
    | Omniscience Strategies | When pulling firebase library, the extension gave an error message. Which was that Manifest v3, new version of extensions platform had different policy as v2 and did not allow pulling library from outside the code. It was migrated recently and did not have much documentation on the solution for this matter even on stack overflow or ChatGPT. | I spent hours doing research but could not find the exact solution for this but was able to figure out it was caused by the v3's new policy and that it does not allow pulling external library. So I decided to copy paste the whole source code for the library. | By copying the whole firebase library directly, I was able to solve the error. |

- growth mindset

    | Situation | Task | Action | Results |
    | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
    | Omniscience Strategies | At first, I had experience with frontend and backend through courses and personal projects, but not much experience on infra and DevOps. I had to learn many things including Terraform, AWS, Docker, infrastructure, and pipelines. | Of course I did some trial and errors during the work time, but also during my free time, I thought about the tech stack that I learned in the work and came up with ideas for personal projects to apply those tech stacks. Like twitter bot using docker and pipeline. | Through applying in my free time, I not only learned deeper on the subject but was also able to create something that I wouldn't had been able to create before. |

- leadership
- teamwork & collaboration

    | Situation | Task | Action | Results |
    | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
    | Fun Hackathon 2024 | We were strangers to each other and not all of us were able to code. | We split up the team so non-coders can work on coming up with ideas for how llm should be used with the text we get from the live audio. We used Git and React to make sure we work on different components to avoid conflicts and also split the presentation parts into parts that each of us were confident in. I took part in explaining tech stack. I also coded feeding live transcript to llm part. | We won 2nd place in the competition!! |
