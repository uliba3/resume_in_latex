# Common questions to answer

## Tell me about yourself. (Tell me about your journey into tech. How did you get interested in coding, and why was x skills a good fit for you? How is that applicable to our role or company goals)

My name is Soobin. I'm a student at The College of Wooster, where I'm majoring in Computer Science and Math. I'll graduate next year.
This past summer, I worked as a Software Developer Intern at startup company and had chance to not just experience but also contribute across the software development lifecycle including frontend, backend, infrastructure, and DevOps tasks using technologies like JavaScript, Python, SQL, Docker, Terraform, and Bash. They extended my internship and I am continuing my internship this semester as well.
In addition to my internship, I've been involved as a CS Research Assistant and Web designer for the school as well.
Outside of work and academics, I've been active in competitive programming, where I've placed in the top rankings in several contests. I have also participated in a Hackathon where my team placed 2nd which was really cool experience.
Overall, I'm passionate about solving problems through code, and I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can continue to grow as a software engineer.

## Why do you want to leave your current/last company?

While I have really enjoyed my time at the startup and appreciate the hands-on experience I’ve gained, it’s a very small company, and I’m now looking for an environment with more opportunities for mentorship and growth. I’m eager to learn from experienced professionals who can guide me in developing my skills further and contribute more meaningfully to larger projects.

## What are you looking for in your next role?

In my next role, I’m looking for opportunities that will support my career growth and development. As a junior software engineer, I want to work in an environment where I can learn from experienced mentors, tackle challenging projects, and continually build my skills. Career development is my top priority. In terms of technology, I’m open to exploring different fields to gain diverse experience and find the areas I’m most passionate about.
