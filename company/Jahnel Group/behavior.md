# Questions

## Tell me about yourself. Walk me through your resume

My name is Soobin. I'm a student at The College of Wooster, where I'm majoring in Computer Science and Math. I'll graduate next year.
This past summer, I worked as a Software Developer Intern at startup company and had chance to not just experience but also contribute across the software development lifecycle including frontend, backend, infrastructure, and DevOps tasks using technologies like JavaScript, Python, SQL, Docker, Terraform, and Bash. They extended my internship and I am continuing my internship this semester as well.
In addition to my internship, I've been involved as a CS Research Assistant and Web designer for the school as well.
Outside of work and academics, I've been active in competitive programming, where I've placed in the top rankings in several contests. I have also participated in a Hackathon where my team placed 2nd which was really cool experience.
Overall, I'm passionate about coding, and since I am graduating next year, I am looking for a software engineer job.

## What do you do outside of work for fun?

For my free time I enjoy going to gym to move my body as well as code for my personal projects. I haven't been able to code for personal projects recently because of school work, but I excited to get back into my personal projects after graduation.

## What are your salary expectations?

Since this is a junior level role, I expect the salary to be around the junior salary, somewhere between 70k to 100k.

## Tell me about a time you were working on a tight deadline?

I guess I can talk about my experience in hackathon I attended this summer. We were supposed to make a product within 2 days by team of 8. But we spent much time just coming up and planning what to make. And by the time we have an idea of what to make, 1st day was already over. So we had to create it in remaining 1 day. We used only 1 branch. But we made sure to seperate our parts by file and reduce variable confusion by using typescript. We were able to complete the product although we didn't have time to create proper presentation, we were able to present it and got 2nd place. I took part in integrating llm api part, and talked about tech stack during the presentation to the 50+ audience. But yeah that was tight deadline.

## If you had to meet a new client and work on a new project, what would you want to know and how would you engage with the client?

If I were to meet a new client and start a project, my top priority would be to fully understand their needs, goals, and expectations. I'd begin by asking in-depth questions to uncover their business challenges, desired outcomes, and the current state of their operations. This is important because sometimes a client’s goals, needs, and expectations may not align, and they might not even be aware of it. By identifying these potential conflicts early, I can help guide the project to align with their true objectives. Rather than jumping straight into technical solutions, I would focus on developing a strategy that addresses their core challenges, using technology as one of the tools to achieve meaningful results.  

## Tell me about a recent project of yours

So right now I am working on the independent research project for my class. And I am creating a AI search application on the past independent research projects from my school. I've finished most of the coding part, so I am focusing on writing the paper, and maybe if I have time, I am thinking of additional features like AI generated image for every research project. But yeah this is my recent project that I am working on.

## What are you looking for in your next position

In my next position, I'm looking for opportunities that will support my career growth and development. As a junior software engineer, I want to work in an environment where I can learn from experienced mentors, take on challenging projects, and continue building my skills. So Career development is definitely my top priority.

## Walk me through a project in your portfolio

Sure, I can talk about twitter bot that I created this summer. So I was doing internship in the start up and just learned about pipeline. I thought I could apply this to create like a bot and I did and created a twitter bot that runs every day at a specific time and feeds the english new and translate and summarize into japanese. I would say I spent more time in creating prompts rather than the code itself. I was actually aiming to get many followers but I only have 40 followers.

## Why do you want to work for Jahnel Group?

One of the key reasons I'm drawn to Jahnel Group is the opportunity to collaborate with diverse clients across various industries, which is not as common in traditional tech roles. The company’s size of around 100 employees strikes a perfect balance—large enough to offer stability and resources, yet small enough to foster close collaboration and innovation. I've also been impressed by Jahnel Group's recent growth, which excites me because I enjoy being part of dynamic, expanding companies. I'm eager to contribute to this growth, leveraging my skills and experience to help drive the company's continued success.
