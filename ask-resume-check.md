# Request for Resume Feedback

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Soobin Yang, and I’m a senior at The College of Wooster, graduating in Spring 2025. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and saw that you’re a recruiter at [Company], as well as a fellow Wooster alum.

I’m currently applying for software engineering positions and was hoping you might be able to provide some feedback on my resume. I’ve attached it to this message and would greatly appreciate any insights you can share.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Soobin Yang
